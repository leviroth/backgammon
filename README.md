The goal of this project is to provide a networked multiplayer implementation of
backgammon. Currently work is focused on the underlying game logic, with a
web-based user interface to follow. An important goal of the project is to
correctly implement the full rules of backgammon, without neglecting (for
example) the rule that all dice must be used when possible.
